			<h3>Background</h3> 
			 <p> This project was made for a upper division design class here at UC San Diego called Social Computing.  In this class we explore the intersection between social behavior and computational systems. The final project for this class was to design a social computing experience that is functional and can be "played" by multiple people within a specific setting.</p>
</div>
			<h3>The Challenge</h3>

        
    

            <p> In today's job market, a staggering  70%. of American workers find themselves unsatisfied with their career choices, a condition that emphasises an issue of career misalignment and dissatisfaction.</p></span></p> <br>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            
			<p>Visual Pathways directly tackles the challenge of career dissatisfaction through an immersive VR platform that builds upon conventional career guidance methods. By simulating real-life work experiences across various industries, it allows students to explore and understand different career paths through virtual reality. This innovative approach helps to demystify job roles and spark interest in various fields by offering students a unique look of the potential career guided by an industry professional. It makes career exploration interactive and engaging, enabling students to better understand their preferences and make informed decisions about their future, minimizing future career changes and dissatisfaction. </p>
      
            <p> Problem Statement</p>
            <p class=findings id="problem-statement"> "How can we design an immersive app that addresses widespread career dissatisfaction by offering interactive, VR-based simulations of various professions, guided by industry professionals, to provide users with a comprehensive and engaging way to explore potential career paths, better aligning their skills and interests with real-world job expectations?"

				<p>We conducted semi-structured interviews and asked about 8-10 questions per interview questions include:</p>
				  <ul>
					<li>Do you think ‘shadowing’ a job via virtual reality would be beneficial in your career search? In what ways would it be beneficial? (Student)</li>
