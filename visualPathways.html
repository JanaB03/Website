  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>This project was made for a upper division design class here at UC San Diego called Social Computing. In this class we explore the intersection between social behavior and computational systems. The final project for this class was to design a social computing experience that is functional and can be "played" by multiple people within a specific setting.</p>
