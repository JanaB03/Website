			<h3>Education Motivation</h3>
			<p class="describe">
				Among various types of mobile apps, the ones devoted to setting academic goals and achievements is a very popular category. Study planner, calenders, tutoring, and much more application now help students to keep track and improvement their academics. This means UX designers work on a variety of interfaces of that kind. This is one of the case study on a application that combines everything from setting goals to finding opportunities. This si specifically intended for students in underserved area who struggle with easily finding resources to help them. Through this case study I hope to bring opportunities for students in underserved areas to have the same access as everybody else.

			<h4>Project</h4>
			<p class="describe">
				UX design of a simple mobile application on setting goals, calendar, tutoring, and finding opportunities and study buddies. 
            </p>
			<h4>Research </h4>
			<p class="describe">In the course of my UX research, I conducted an extensive exploration of the user landscape, employing various methodologies that are fundamental to user experience research. To gain profound insights into the academic journey of high school graduates now attending college, I engaged in user interviews. These interviews were structured to delve into the intricacies of their academic experiences during high school, uncover the strategies they employed to build their academic resumes, and shed light on their internship experiences. The questions posed during these interviews aimed to extract essential data, employing open-ended inquiries and probing techniques. By speaking directly with these individuals, who have navigated the educational system and internship search process, I acquired critical insights into their behaviors, preferences, and pain points. This data is invaluable as it informs the design and functionality of the comprehensive app, ensuring it truly caters to the needs and aspirations of students in their academic journey and beyond.</p>
            <h4>Idea</h4>
            <p>
                In conceptualizing my UX case study, I envisioned an innovative and comprehensive app that would serve as a one-stop solution for students' diverse needs. This app is designed to seamlessly integrate multiple tools essential for students, including a user-friendly tutoring platform, a robust resource for discovering academic opportunities such as scholarships and internships, an intuitive study planner, goal-setting features, and a network for connecting with fellow students. A distinctive element of the app is its login mechanism, requiring students to use their school district and student ID, allowing for accurate identification of their location and academic affiliations. This idea represents a holistic approach to enhancing the student experience, simplifying access to crucial resources, and fostering a sense of community among students. Through this case study, I aim to demonstrate how user-centered design principles can be applied to create a truly indispensable tool for students.
            </p>
			<h4> Analysis</h4>
			<p class="describe">The analysis of the interview data revealed a significant trend that more than half of the interviewees secured their internships through pre-existing personal connections. This insight underscores the prevailing challenge of equitable internship opportunities, as they appear to be heavily reliant on one's existing network. In response to this finding, the overarching goal of the app I envisioned is to address this very problem of internship accessibility. By consolidating a wide array of essential features, including tutoring resources, scholarship listings, internship opportunities, and study planning tools within a single, user-friendly platform, the app seeks to level the playing field. It aims to democratize access to vital resources and opportunities, ensuring that every student can readily access the tools and connections they need to thrive in their academic and professional journey. This analysis reinforces the app's central mission: to empower students with a comprehensive and inclusive resource hub that fosters educational and career success for all.</p>

			<h4>Reflection</h4>
			<p class="describe">If I were to actually work on this project and expand it even further I would focus on gaining interviews and feedback from users. I would also focus on the aesthetic of it. As well I create a prototype and test by gaining feedback from the users.
